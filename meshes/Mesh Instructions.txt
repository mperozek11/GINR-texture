Ball Creation:

Spikeyball1:
    - Subdivided icosphere with 1 iteration
    - Beveled vertices
    - Extrude and scale
    - Scale midpoint to create needles
    - Subdivide and smooth laplacian twice
    
Spikeyball2
    - Beveled vertices
    - Extrude and scale
    - Scale midpoint to create needles
    - Subdivide and smooth laplacian three times
    
Blobball
    - Created 2 meshes (1 big icosphere and 1 small sm)
    - Made big sphere the parent of the small sphere
    - Put instances of smaller sphere on all bigger sphere's vertices
    - Make all instances real and detach from each other
    - Joined all meshes together
    - Selected all outside vertices and deleted interior
    - Cleaned non-manifold
    - Remeshed
    
RounderPixelCube
    - Created 2 meshes (1 big sphere and 1 small cube)
    - Made big sphere the parent of the small cube
    - Put instances of smaller cube on all bigger sphere's vertices
    - Make all instances real and detach from each other
    - Joined all meshes together
    - Selected all outside vertices and deleted interior
    - Cleaned non-manifold
    - Remeshed
    
Crinkleball
    - Sculpted sphere to look wrinkly
    - Smooth vertices
    - Remesh
    
NeedleBall
    - Used UV sphere
    - Beveled vertices
    - Extrude and scale
    - Scale midpoint to create needles
    - Subdivide and smooth laplacian three times
    
GeometricQuadSpikeyBall
    - Used quadsphere
    - Beveled vertices

    - Scale midpoint to create needles
    - Subdivide and smooth laplacian three times
    
QuadSpikeyBall
    - Subdivided quadsphere with 1 iteration
